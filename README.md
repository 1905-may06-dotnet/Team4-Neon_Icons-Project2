## Objective:
Neon Icons is a full-stack web application for displaying the current weather forecast with accompanying music. The user will register on our site, and the application will query a weather API with the provided location. Logic in the back-end will reference an enumeration to map the current forecast to an appropriate genre, which will then query a music API and play a song. 

Additionally, the user will be able to set custom preferences for weather and genre matches in order to personalize the experience.

We will observe Agile methodologies in our development approach. This project will be developed in accordance with SOLID design principles, and produce a layered architecture.
